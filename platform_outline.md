## EAVP 

EAVP is an ERTICO innovation platform for collaboration on a hands-on-working level, networking and the establishment of partnerships with all necessary Automated Valet Parking stakeholders.

### AVP Benefits
To support the EU vision of better mobility and urban quality of life, AVP (Automated Valet Parking) aims on supporting the optimisation of the public space usage whilst improving todayâ€™s driver parking experience. Moreover, AVP helps moving parking to the next digital & automated service level.
